# Recommended OpenAI Image Model

As of this project, the recommended OpenAI image generation model is `gpt-image-1` (the branded image generation model provided by OpenAI).

Why `gpt-image-1`?
- It is the up-to-date OpenAI image model designed for high-quality image generation and is supported by the official OpenAI SDK.
- It accepts rich textual prompts and returns base64-encoded image data which can be saved as PNG/JPEG.

If OpenAI releases newer image models (or branded names like DALL·E), prefer the most recent dedicated image model and check the OpenAI SDK docs for the exact model name and parameters.
